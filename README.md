# Shadberry Game Engine

Every programmer should try and develop a game engine. This is my attempt to develop an engine and a minecraft clone using it.

# Build

Just run run-mcc.ps1 to run the sample project.

Run run-shadberry-tests.ps1 to run the engine tests.

For both scripts you can specify the configuration as -Config [Config], available options: Debug, RelWithDebugInfo (default), Release.
